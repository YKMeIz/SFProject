In order to make tremulous-data distributable by Fedora Randy 'ydnar' Reddig
has been contacted and asked to relicense his textures under a more Fedora
Friendly license, this was his response:

"I already released the Tremulous textures (I think) under a CC license so
it could be included with Debian. This should suffice for FC right?

Randy"

Unfortunatly this was hopefull, but to vague to be usefull. So another mail
was send to Randy to ask him for clarification, which he (sofar) hasn't
answered. Since Randy mentioned Debian the Debian maillists were searched
and there it was claimed that Randy send an explicit permission notice to
the tremulous maintainer for redistribution under the CC license used by
the rest of tremulous-data. So contant was sought with the tremulous
maintainer to confirm this, and this has been confirmed. Thus we can
distribute tremulous data completely under the "Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike" license without exceptions!

Here is the mail from the tremulous maintainer confirming the removal of the
license exception:

"This is for all the textures & other assets that Tremulous uses.

Thanks for the effort, but I'm afraid this is something that isn't appropriate for trunk. Tremulous is a cross platform title and as such we want to keep dynamic library dependencies at a minimum as they become difficult to deal with across multiple platforms. Since the static JPEG code already works and does not have any library dependencies, this is most appropriate for the cross platform version. Obviously if you want to use this patch for your own packaging efforts that's fine.

If you ever want to submit patches in the future, http://bugzilla.icculus.org/ is the correct place.

Thanks. :)
