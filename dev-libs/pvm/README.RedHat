To configure this release of PVM to work you need to do
one or more of the following:

- set the PVM_ROOT variable in the user's startup files (usually 
  .bashrc). Note: rsh won't go through the files used at login,
  so e.g. .profile and .bash_profile don't work). This
  also needs to be set on the remote systems in some way.

- set the PVM_ROOT on a system-wide basis, e.g. in /etc/bashrc.
  Same restrictions as above: login files are not used.
