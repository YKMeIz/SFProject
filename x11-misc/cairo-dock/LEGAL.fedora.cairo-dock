cairo-dock was on Fedora, however due to some legal concern
it was removed from Fedora on 2009. This time with assistance
from the upstream developer I removed the potential legal
concern part from cairo-dock tarball, which was accepted
by Red Hat legal authority (see:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178911#c8
)
