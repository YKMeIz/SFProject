.SH NAME
pac \- Perl Auto Connector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pac [-start_tray]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pac
is a (simple?) GUI to manage/launch connections to remote machines with:

	- Configurable [Pre|Post]-connection local commands execution.

	- Configurable list of macros (commands) to send to connected client.

	- Configurable list of macros (commands) to execute locally when connected.

	- Configurable list of conditional executions on connected machine via 'Expect':

		. forget about SSH certificates

		. chain multiple ssh connections

		. automate tunnels creation

		. etc

	- Ability to connect to machines through a Proxy server!

	- Scripting (Perl language), just like SecureCRT, but much better! :P

	- Wake On LAN capabilities

	- TABBED/WINDOWED terminals

	- Possibility to *CLUSTER* terminals!!

	- Local and Global variables, eg.: write down a password once, use it ANY where, centralizing its modification for faster changes! use them for:

		. password vault

		. reusing connection strings

		. etc

	- Seamless Gnome/Gtk integration.

	- Tray icon for 'right button' quick launching of managed connections.

	- Written in Perl/Gtk (wait, *is* that a feature? Well, it is for me! ;=)
