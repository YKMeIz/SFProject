DSSI 1.1.1 Release Notes

DSSI is a plugin API for software instruments with user interfaces,
permitting them to be hosted in-process by audio applications. It is
intended to be simple, GUI-toolkit-agnostic, and slightly biased
towards familiarity with MIDI. The DSSI distribution package
contains a JACK/ALSA-sequencer reference host and some plugins as
well as the specification and header. 

Changes: The only change since the 1.1.0 release is a fix to a crash
on startup in one of the example plugins (less_trivial_synth).
