There are a number of plugins packaged with the Fedora Extras Quod
Libet package that are not a part of the upstream Quod Libet release.
Some of them may have dependencies that are not available in Fedora
Core or Extras.  Some plugins may have bugs that prevent them from
working at all.  The plugins have been included to make the task of
getting all of the plugins downloaded and installed easier for the end
user.
